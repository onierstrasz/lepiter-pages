In the Morphic World you can see that Iceberg prompts you for the github username and email.- You can enter these in the dialog pane.- Another thing you can do is:- ```language=text
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```- This creates a .gitconfig file in your home directory.- See also: [[How to work with git branches]]
