It appears that snippets in pages that do not belong to a database have no uid, so when they are rendered, they can be incorrectly reused (they all have a `nil` uid).- The solution is to assign a fake database to the slideshow to which the pages can belong.- This needs to be added to {{gtClass:name=PrioritySlideshow}}.- Added a {{gtMethod:name=PrioritySlideshow>>#db}} slot and lazy initializer.- Every subclass can implement `initializeDb`. See for example {{gtMethod:name=SmalltalkIntroSlideshow>>#initializeDb|expanded}}- Slides that need local pages can grab them from the db, for example: {{gtMethod:name=SmalltalkIntroSlideshow>>#everythingIsAnObject:|expanded}}
