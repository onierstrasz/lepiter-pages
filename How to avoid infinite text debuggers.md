This allows you see where the BlText is breaking without producing an infinite number of walkbacks. If you don’t want to mess with it, I understand.”- ( BlBlocUIManager>>#handleDebugRequest:) removeFromSystem- **NB** you must keep the Morphic World open, or you won't be able to access it when you get a freeze.
