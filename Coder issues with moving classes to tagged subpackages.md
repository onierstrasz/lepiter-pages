Can't change both the package and tag at the same time.- Let's create a dummy class.- Object subclass: #Dummy		instanceVariableNames: ''		classVariableNames: ''		poolDictionaries: ''		package: 'Dummy-Stuff'- Now try to rename the Package to `Dummy` and the Tag to `Stuff` and commit. Nothing happens.- 2. Can't rename the “Uncategorized” subpackage.- Let's create two dummy classes:- Object subclass: #Dummy1		instanceVariableNames: ''		classVariableNames: ''		poolDictionaries: ''		package: 'Dummy'.Object subclass: #Dummy2		instanceVariableNames: ''		classVariableNames: ''		poolDictionaries: ''		package: 'Dummy'- Now add the `Stuff` tag to `Dummy`, leaving `Dummy2` as uncategorized.- Select the `Uncategorized` group and try to rename it to `Other`.- This generates a `Package tag Uncategorized does not exist` error.
