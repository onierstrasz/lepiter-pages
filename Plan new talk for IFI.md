Idea to focus on the data exploration.

Programming, data science and knowledge management are usually three distinct and separate technologies.

Programming = IDE
Data Science = Jupyter notebooks
Knowledge Management = wiki

For GT they are the same.- Much cheaper to just start doing things.- Possible demos:    - REST API    - GraphQL — it's another language        - They aren't Smalltalk objects    - PolyPoly
