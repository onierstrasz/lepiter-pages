We look for the senders and find two.- #newTranscriptButtonStencil gtSenders- We can inspect an instance.- GtHomeToolsSection new newTranscriptButtonStencil- Clicking it seems to do what we want (except for opening it in a new window).- If we dive into the action of  {{gtMethod:name=GtHomeToolsSection>>newTranscriptButtonStencil}}, we find that the following is performed.- BlSpace new	title: 'Transcript';	addChild: GtTranscriptStencil new asElement;	yourself- But this is added to a Card. Where does the card come from?- How do we find out how a page is opened in a new window?- We can drill into the `Open in a new Window` checkbox and explore the `Action` tab of the button.- We find the action is defined in{{gtMethod:name=GtWorldTabElement>>newToolbarForTabModel:}}.
