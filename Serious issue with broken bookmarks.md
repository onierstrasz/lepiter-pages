---Title: Serious issue with broken bookmarks---#Serious issue with broken bookmarks- [[issue]]- Started with a bookmark in my lepiter db pointing to a page in the gt book.- I started editing the gtbook pages, but when I was done, there was nothing to commit.- Apparently the bookmarked link pointed to a new "ghost" page, and all the changes were ghosts. By exploring allInstances of LePage, I could find the lost pages and recover them, but then it was impossible to merge them.- I could move some of the ghosts to my lepiter db, and recreate the others using the storeStrings. Then I could recover the JSON of those pages and rewrite the gtbook versions.
