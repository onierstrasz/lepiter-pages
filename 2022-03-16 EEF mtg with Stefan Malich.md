Over 60 members.

[[SM]] joined 2019. Interested in Enterprise Architecture in industry and academia.

Currently no entry point to EEF.

Main goal of EEF is to promote Essence in SE courses.

Should have an open repository (like github) to support an ecosystem of Essence practices. Current tools are close source ... These practices can then be imported into an organization.

Essence shouldn'r *replace* traditional books and manuals, but rather offer an “access layer” to these sources.
