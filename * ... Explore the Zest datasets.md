See below.- #EMail from Alberto    - I wanted to suggest that we take a closer look at two datasets we are currently dissecting for our reproduction studies:    - — [code_review dataset](https://github.com/RosaliaTufano/code_review)        - (from the paper: [Towards Automating Code Review Activities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02518.pdf))    - — [code_review_automation dataset](https://github.com/RosaliaTufano/code_review_automation)        - (from the paper: [Using Pre-Trained Models to Boost Code Review Automation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.06850.pdf))    - If you review these paper's abstracts and skim the papers, you should have a general idea of what these datasets entail. To better understand them and create meaningful questions to explore, it may be more efficient to schedule a call to discuss them together. Would this be feasible for you?    - If so, please let me know some dates and times that work for you. Alternatively, you can choose from my availability [here](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/ab8994bb96c64baa82b2118b7b59df3c@uzh.ch/meetingtype/sqvnoz0_SUOUxfUJwUAF8Q2?anonymous).- #Exploring the first dataset    - See the [GH repo README](https://github.com/RosaliaTufano/code_review#readme).    - codeReviewRepo := 'codeReview' asFileReference.

Done to simplify training.    - Can share with me the prepocessing steps and the data    - The question is what happens in the leaky pipeline from the initial to the cleaned dataset.        - Have the processing code but have not analyzing it.
