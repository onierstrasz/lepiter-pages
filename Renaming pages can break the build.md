---Title: Renaming pages can break the build---#Renaming pages can break the build- [[todo]] [[bug]] {{gtTodo:label=FixPageRenaming}}- Renaming a Note page can result in multiple pages with the same name (though it shouldn't). When building a new Gt, at some point the default Lepiter database is loaded. If a duplicate page is found, an error is generated (where?).- Can be fixed by searching manually in the file system for multiple lepiter files with the same title property.- Probably needs a fix somewhere in {{gtMethod:LePage>>updateTitle:}}.
