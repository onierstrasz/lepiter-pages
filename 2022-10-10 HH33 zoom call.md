---Title: 2022-10-10 HH33 zoom call---#2022-10-10 HH33 zoom call- [[meetings]] [[HH33]]- Needs help with Pharo:- Well : I get how conceptually Pharo works (and love it) but I don't know such things as 
- Where to type my code to create a new object?
- How do I configure Seaside to change the localhost port on which my demo app is served?
- Where do one host the code for a pharo app? on special servers?
- Do I need to type code for the server ?
- And so on. 
I'd love if someone could tutor me/"give" me lessons once every X moment of time. 
Thank you for your time.- Goal is to have a todo web app, probably using Seaside.- Not sure whether to use Pharo or GT.- (Does Seaside work with GT?)- Will read Pharo by Example and play some more with GT before getting back to me.
