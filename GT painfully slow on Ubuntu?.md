---Title: GT painfully slow on Ubuntu?---#GT painfully slow on Ubuntu?- [[bug]] [[todo]]- I was curious about Pharo and wanted to see what was built with it before diving in, Iâ€™m not familiar with Pharo yet. I saw this project and it looked interesting. 
I encountered some barriers in exploring it though:
1. can't find gtoolkit on any Linux package manager
2. once installed, I found the program very slow - from rendering the tour slides to simply typing on Ubuntu 21.04
3. since being slow makes it difficult to explore, I tried to find an online demo or video that would take less than 5 minutes to understand what value this software brings. The 37 minute video on the landing page is the smallest I could find

Would love to know without a big time investment what other tech should I compare gtoolkit with and what does it do different.- [https://discord.com/channels/729445214812504107/735947900651175998/944415080731267134](https://discord.com/channels/729445214812504107/735947900651175998/944415080731267134)
