---Title: Can't iterate through all objects using nextObject---#Can't iterate through all objects using nextObject- [[bug]] [[todo]]- Very strange anomaly. If we try to walk through all objects in memory, we somehow reach the value 0, though we should not.- This fails with `#nextObject` being sent to `0`, but if we examine the buffer of the last ten objects, it is not the correct nextObject in the list.- someObject := Object someObject.buffer := OrderedCollection new.buffer addLast: someObject.currentObject := someObject nextObject.count := 1.[ currentObject == someObject ] whileFalse: [ 	count := count + 1.	buffer addLast: currentObject.	buffer size > 10 ifTrue: [ buffer removeFirst ].	currentObject := currentObject nextObject ].count
