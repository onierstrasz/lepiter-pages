For the explanation, see [[How to talk to Iceberg]].    - class := BrProgress.IceRepository registry	select: [ :repo | (repo packages collect: #name) includes: class package name ]    - Below follow the old notes- —————————————————————————————————————————————————- #Pharo Days discussion    - Discussion with Benoit ? and Noury at Pharo Days.    - This information is stored in Iceberg (if a project is registered).    - There is also a “git bridge” (a class? a tool? a project?)    - Can search within github for a file (Class.st) within a given user or organization        - See [Finding files on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/finding-files-on-github)        - For example, to find which repo the class `BlElementEventListener` belongs (or belonged) to:        - You can find a file within a given repo: [](https://github.com/feenkcom/gtoolkit/find/main)        - You can search for a specific file with a [filename search](https://github.com/search?q=filename%3ABlBasicEventHandler.st)- #Finding BlElement    - Example: how to find the repo where {{gtClass:BlElement}} is defined?    - The process seems unreliable at best.    - The package is Bloc.    - BlElement package    - We can look for {{gtClass:BaselineOfBloc}}. (Doesn't work for all packages.)    - We find references to the feenkcom github repo and find the [Bloc repo](https://github.com/feenkcom/Bloc).    - In the src folder we find the Bloc package and the [BlElement class source file](https://github.com/feenkcom/Bloc/blob/main/src/Bloc/BlElement.class.st).- #Finding OrderedCollection    - We find the package.    - OrderedCollection package    - We look for a baseline.    - #baseline: gtImplementors & OrderedCollection package name gtSubstringMatch    - We find two that depend on it, namely {{gtMethod:name=BaselineOfKernelTests>>#baseline:}} and {{gtMethod:name=BaselineOfPharoBootstrap>>#baseline:}}.    - Well, everything appears to be in the [Pharo github repo](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo/tree/Pharo10/src), so we directly find the [OrderedCollection source file](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo/blob/Pharo10/src/Collections-Sequenceable/OrderedCollection.class.st).- #Ideas    - Build an index of classes and repos? Knowing which repos are out there, crawl them using the github api and build an index?    - The [load script for GT](https://github.com/feenkcom/gtoolkit-maestro-rs/blob/main/scripts/installer.sh).    - First find the package.    - Then try to find the relevant baseline.    - #baseline: gtImplementors & 'GToolkit-SearchFilters' gtSubstringMatch    - But this gives the baselines that depend on this package, not the baseline ofthe package itself ...- Collection package- #baseline: gtImplementors & Collection package name gtSubstringMatch
