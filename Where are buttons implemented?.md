---Title: Where are buttons implemented?---#Where are buttons implemented?- [[howto]]  [[randomnote]]  [[lepiter]]- See also [[How to open a lepiter page in a new tab]].- We want to know how to implement new buttons with actions. This can be done in various ways.- #Inspector buttons    - If we inspect an object, we get several inspector buttons.    - 'foo'    - There is {{gtMethod:name=ProtoObject>>#gtActionInspectInWindowFor:}} and three more.    - They are all defined in Object or ProtoObject and have a gtAction pragma.    - #gtAction gtPragmas  & Object gtMethodsInClass    - #gtAction gtPragmas  & ProtoObject gtMethodsInClass    - So it seems that if we add a gtACtion method to a specific class, instances of that class will get a button in the inspector.    - Let's try to add a "Help" button to ByteString that does nothing but show a tooltip.    - ByteString compile: 'gtHelpFor: anAction	<gtAction>	^ anAction button		icon: BrGlamorousIcons help;		tooltip: ''Help'';		action: [  ]'    - Indeed, now when we inspect a string we see the new button.    - 'foo'- #LePage buttons    - We can't inspect the view code of the "Copy as Remote Reference" and "Remove page" buttons. Where are they implemented?    - Let's try to dive into the UI. We find{{gtMethod:name=LePageHeaderBuilder>>#addRemoteLinkToClipboardButton}} in the Action of the first button.    - The second button just has an `initialize` action. We'll do a brute force search.    - 'Remove Page' gtSubstringMatch    - We find {{gtMethod:name=LePageHeaderBuilder>>#addRemovePageButton}}.    - So in both cases we add buttons to the toolbarElement in a {{gtClass:name=LePageHeaderBuilder}} method.    - Let's try to add a new button.    - LePageHeaderBuilder compile: 'addBrowseButton	"Test of adding a new help button that does nothing."	| newButton |	newButton := BrButton new 		aptitude: BrGlamorousButtonWithIconAptitude;		label: ''Browse'';		icon: BrGlamorousVectorIcons emphasizedBrowse;		action: [ :aButton |  ].	self toolbarElement addItem: newButton.'    - We also have to send this message somewhere. There appear to be multiple `build` methods.    - If we follow the breadcrumbs, the one that's actually used seems to be {{gtMethod:name=LePageHeaderWithTitleAndRemoveActionBuilder>>#build}}.    - Let's try to add the new browse button.    - LePageHeaderWithTitleAndRemoveActionBuilder compile: 'build	self removeAllItems.	self addTitle.	self addRemoteLinkToClipboardButton.	self addRemovePageButton.	"self addBrowseButton."	self addTableOfContentsToggle.	self addExtensionButtons.'    - Now let's open a new view of this page:[[Where are buttons implemented?]]    - That works!    - What are the extension buttons added in {{gtMethod:name=LePageHeaderBuilder>>#addExtensionButtons|expanded}}    - #leHeaderAction gtPragmas
