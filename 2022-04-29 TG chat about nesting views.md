Without that you end up flatting information.- In the Cozy Corner example there were many nesting levels.- When you realize there is something interesting down the line, that is the time to add a new view. Start with the existing view perhaps, then adapt and extend it.- For example, in the Ludo Game Board views, we might add to the Players view more information about the Tokens and their states.- Similarly if you are navigating the raw tree view repeatedly, you should create a new view.- How do we teach this?- #Tools- In GT we have thousands of tools, but they all start from the software and are all in the same flow.- #TDD- Why do cleanup? Why move towards immutability?- The views will push you to clean up and refactor the code.- The need to visualize interesting states will drive you towards cleanup and redesign.- #Planning- Can work together next week on the Ludo example and P2 lecture.
