The test should recreate the state of the object and the inputs, and generate assertions for the state change before and after the method.- The reason could either be to generate a missing test, or to generate a test while debugging to demonstrate the wrong state.- 1/0- The tricky part is that the object state and the arguments may touch the whole object graph of the universe. But some simple analysis could show which parts are actually needed by the method for testing purposes.- In Smalltalk could use Method Wrappers to capture the state before and after. In Java could use AspectJ.
