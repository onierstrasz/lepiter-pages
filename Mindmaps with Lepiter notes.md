---Title: Mindmaps with Lepiter notes---#Mindmaps with Lepiter notes- [[todo]] [[projects]] [[lepiter]] [[imad]]- The idea is to create mindmaps where each card is a lepiter note.- A mindmap could be created automatically taking an arbitrary note as a root, and following links depth-first to create a tree view.    - Another way could be to select all nodes with a given tag, and to generate the map starting from some given node. (Think of the WikiLinks app.)- Alternatively, a mindmap could be created by hand, adding new notes, or integrating existing ones.- A mindmap could be saved as a storeString, as in [[IMAD]], or it could be a new kind of Lepiter note, stored in the lepiter database. The tree structure would be saved together with any positioning and styling of the nodes.- [[AC]] thinks it would be better as a snippet rather than a page.    - Look at the Wardley maps snippet. That's a full view that stores everything in the Lepiter database.
