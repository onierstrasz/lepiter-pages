---Title: Shared Pools don't work in GT?---#Shared Pools don't work in GT?- [[bug]] [[todo]]- [[SE]] says that shared pools don't work.- See [Issue 2440](https://github.com/feenkcom/gtoolkit/issues/2440).- See [Sharedpools](https://github.com/StephanEggermont/Pools) repo- See {{gtClass:PoolsSource}} and  {{gtClass:name=PoolsUse}}.- Seems to work when loaded:- PoolsUse new returnOne- But the method {{gtMethod:name=PoolsUse>>returnOne|expanded}} shows `ONE` as undefined.- The fixits seem to be irrelevant.- With the projects listed in the issue, they did not load properly, and could not connect to database.
