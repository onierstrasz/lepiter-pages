All you need to do is edit the config files and push them.- #To dos    - GT is itself a case study. Would be nice to have more case studies like the Squarified Treemap page    - Could move the VISSOFT pages and slides to a presentation section of the book, or to the Ludo case study section.    - Should look at the Lifeware infrastructure.    - It's a fully distributed Smalltalk. It heavily leverages the work on Promises and Streams.    - Lifeware wants us to publicize the work!
