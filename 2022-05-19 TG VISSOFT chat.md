The difference lies in how important it is.    - What we are saying is: If you want to develop software, don't read code.    - The claim is stronger. You should do it our way, or you will get into trouble.    - Not just every domain but every problem is different.    - Off-the-shelf views and Visual languages are limited. UML Offers nothing for security or performance.    - Every specialized language or tool is optimized for certain questions, but offers nothing for others.    - Software is multidimensional. Instead of seeing visualization as a niche community, it should be the core.    - You need visualizations that cross-cut dimensions. So instead of domain-specific views, we want views at the finest level of granularity, that is, the object.    - Two ways of creating narratives: (1) cascading ones of views, and (2) within lepiter.- #Examples    - Example from Don Roberts of balancing trees — the visualization gives you a pre-defined language. Knowing how to visualize data becomes an essential skill.        - Ten years from now, people will hire experts in creating visual narratives about software.    - Example of tailored Profiler used to optimize frames to under 16 ms.    - Profiling the Ludo game (press the fourth button):        - GtLudoRecordingGame new autoPlay: 1000    - Andrei made a specialized tool to visualize the loading of GT.        - loadingLog := Clipboard  clipboardText asString.

The first is generic, and the second highlights in grey the external components that GT depends on.    - Thinks that an extended example on domain analysis rather than source code would be more interesting. I.e., the restaurant example.        - Metacello new

See the project-polypoly channel?    - Some examples.    - See the StepsFigure view. Green steps succeeded; red ones failed. This visualizes the algorithm in the paper on [Squarified TreeMaps](https://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/stm.pdf).    - BrTextEditorSelecterExamples new select_word_at_2    - GtGraphTreemapLayoutExamples new squarifyWithSevenNodes    - GtGraphCircleNeighbourhoodExamples new emptyNeighborhoodWithThreeCirclesAndSpace    - GtWhatMakesBlocSpecialExplanation    - We see all the classes in GT. Blue are classes with at least one custom view. Green classes host examples. This backs up the claim that the need is pervasive.        - GtTour new treemapWithViewsAndExamples- What about longer stories?
