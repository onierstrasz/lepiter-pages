Started with the inspector.- # Moldable Views    - Shows multiple views of steps of an algorithm.    - Key idea: no single way of describing anything, so need moldable views.    - Examples are tests that return an object.        - {{gtMethod:name=BrTextEditorSelecterExamples>>select_word_at_2}}    - Code browsing: can expand in place. Navigate to views of examples.    - Example of code loader {{gtClass:name=GtRlProjectLoadDirective}} instance.    - Views are not necessarily exciting, but they are brought together: can easily navigate.- #Case study: feature toggle dependencies    - System with Feature toggles    - See visualization only showing dependencies of feature toggles    - Can click on dependency arrows and see the usages (in a Moose group).    - Need ability to easily build custom tools to answer domain-specific questions.    - Case study leverages a SmaCC Python parser.    - NB: Python parser grammar can be explored within the same language workbench (not just Smalltalk).- #Lepiter    - A “Moldable knowledge platform”    - Can take notes. Can be nested. Create links.    - Shows link to the slideshow he is displaying.    - Link to a class. Shows completions.        - NB: can be language-specific. Completions are searched in a different space.        - gtClass searches the space of classes. gtMethod will search a method space etc.    - Can navigate links eg to class {{gtClass:name=BlElement}}.    - From there can maximize and go to Coder view.    - Link to example: {{gtExample:name=BaselineOfGToolkit class>>itself|noCode=true|previewShow=gtMapFor:}}.    - This is a todo {{gtTodo:label=Give the UKST talk|completed=2022-03-30}}.        - Extendible -- can have calendar extensions for todos.    - Shows different kinds of snippets.    - #gtView gtPragmas- #Visualization    - How to visualize the current (lepiter) database: {{gtPage:How to visualize the current database|db=2j9m7db2i4oz116bexd7wbdxo}}.    - Inspects `thisSnippet`    - pages := thisSnippet database pages    - Pages are connected. Build a Mondrian graph of pages,    - Some central node turns out to be the TOC (of the GT book), which is linked to everything.    - Goes to {{gtPage:Mapping Moldable Development|db=2j9m7db2i4oz116bexd7wbdxo}}.    - Views should be live, else they will get out of sync.    - Shows how you can navigate from a page back to where it was linked from, i.e from {{gtPage:Software Assessment|db=2j9m7db2i4oz116bexd7wbdxo}} back to {{gtPage:Mapping Moldable Development|db=2j9m7db2i4oz116bexd7wbdxo}}.- #Case study: using JS with Pharo    - {{gtPage:Visualizing yarn.lock files using JavaScript and Pharo|db=2j9m7db2i4oz116bexd7wbdxo}}    - Can also use external environment to execute code (JS etc).- #Reverse engineering and model navigation    - Facebook imported data view.    - Visualization of FB data imported into GT. Can build a model and navigate, eg to FB reactions.    - Various dedicated views of model elements.    - Queries like: when did I talk with this person ....    - **NB:** *Views are not just interesting in isolation, but can be used in the context of a more complex narrative.*    - Individual nodes are small, but *composable*. It's not so much about the PL but the environment.- #Twitter use case    - Find all pages with open tweets.    - Can tweet directly from GT! (via a relay server) [example tweet](https://twitter.com/girba/status/1509245521801711617)- #More stuff    - lepiter database integrated in git repos    - ##new infrastructure for streams, futures, promises        - A small query (fast):        - 'Object' gtClassMatches        - A large query (still fast):        - 'a' gtClassMatches        - Can also explore large classes like {{gtClass:name=BlElement}} quickly.    - ##remote runner        - `Playing with Remote Runner`        - Works with {{gtClass:name=GtRemoteRunner}}.        - GtRemoteRunner default        - Can use it to run examples remotely on remote workers.        - Can check remote status        - Can explore remote failures. Can stream remote objects back.- #Wrapping up    - Lepiter databases are stored on disk and can be synced to a repo.    - Streaming and remote jobs were critical to working with lareg amounts of data.- #Q&A    - Remote workers -- can be anywhere?    - How can GT support other communities?        - TG: there is a crisis — cannot reason about the things we build. *Software Environmentalism* addresses this. Our main goal is to start a conversation about *moldable development*.        - Smalltalk wasn't created for building software, but for people to create personal experiences.        - The environment is the language.        - How do you reach out to a community that not only doesn't share your language but your ways of communicating — you can start with a common environment.    - How can we take this conversation to the business modeling level? — [Graham McLeod](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grahamatinspired/)        - Need a medium to talk with domain experts from models all the way down to code.        - TG: we work with companies on “domain discovery”.        - Can get a great conversation going inside an inspector!        - Simple pictures (views) can help to identify fundamental issues in just seconds.        - If in a few weeks (or days) you can say new things about a system that people have worked with for years, then this is remarkable. Something is wrong if you don't have moldable views of your system.    - How did you get GT to look so glamorous?        - We built a completely new graphics stack, not morphic, but inspired by it.        - Core idea is a single rendering tree for all kinds of graphical elements.        - Hard to do — just having links that are dynamically rendered as you type is very hard. Don't know of another graphical stack that does this.        - Example of BrEditor — embedded editors. Everything works without any modal views.        - That's why the environment is the language.
