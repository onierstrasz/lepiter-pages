---Title: Class comment Lepiter database---#Class comment Lepiter database- [[todo]] [[projects]] [[lepiter]]- The idea is to create a Lepiter database from class comments.- See also [[How to delete dead databases from the Lepiter registry]]- #How to create a Lepiter database?    - How to create one programatically?    - dir := (FileLocator imageDirectory / 'commentsLepiter') ensureCreateDirectory.registry := LeDatabasesRegistry uniqueInstance defaultLogicalDatabase.registry addKnowledgebaseFromDirectory: dir.registry databases    - NB: There was a bug in {{gtMethod:name=LeLogicalDatabase>>#addKnowledgebaseFromDirectory:}}, which sent `resolved` instead of `resolve`. It's now fixed.- #How to create pages in a Lepiter database?    - db := LeDatabasesRegistry uniqueInstance defaultLogicalDatabase databases	detect: [ :each | each databaseName matches: '*commentsLepiter' ].    - page := LePage named: 'Home'.page addSnippet: (LeTextSnippet new string: 'contents').db addPage: page.db.- #How to populate a database from class comments.    - Collection withAllSubclasses	do: [ :each | 		| page |		page := LePage named: each name.		page addSnippet: (LeTextSnippet new string: each comment).		db addPage: page ]    - NB: This creates just a single snippet for each class comment and doesn't create any links between pages.
