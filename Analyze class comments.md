---Title: Analyze class comments---#Analyze class comments- [[todo]]  [[asap]] [[projects]] [[comment-analysis]]- See also [[Stereotype analysis for Pharo classes]]- See issue #2711 [Some class comments are still in Pillar format](https://github.com/feenkcom/gtoolkit/issues/2711)- Collaborate with [[PR]].- #Ideas- Automatically link class comments to lepiter docs.    - [[TG]] proposes to automatically include links to relevant Lepiter pages from class comments. How?- Analyze presence of class comments in Pharo and GT    - Which classes have or lack class comments?    - Which *important* classes need comments?        - Which classes are important?        - Root classes of heavily used hierarchies? How to measure usage?        - (Lots of references, or many subclasses, fan-in, fan-out)        - Which are root classes?        - Which have a lot of code?  (methods with code)        - Which have lots of tests/examples?    - Which classes belong to Pharo or GT? (Packages, repos)    - What information is present in class comments?        - What heuristics did [[PR]] use?- #Snippets- Sort Collection classes by comment size.    - Collection withAllSubclasses sort: [:a :b | a comment size < b comment size ]- All classes excluding metaclasses, this takes about 8 seconds:- (Object withAllSubclasses reject: #isMeta) sort: [:a :b | a comment size < b comment size ]- There are 34 classes with 'TODO' class comments.- (Object withAllSubclasses reject: #isMeta) select: [:ea | ea comment = 'TODO']- There are over 11K classes with truly empty (not generated) class comments.- (Object withAllSubclasses reject: #isMeta) select: [ :each | 	each instanceSide organization classComment isEmpty ]- These are the one-line comments:- (Object withAllSubclasses reject: [ :each | 	 each isMeta or: [ 		 each comment = 'TODO' or: [ 			 each instanceSide organization classComment isEmpty or: [ 				 each comment includes: Character cr ] ] ] ]) sort: [ :a :b | 	a comment size > b comment size ]- These are multi-line comments. (Though many are just a single line with a CR at the end.)- (Object withAllSubclasses reject: [ :each | 	 each isMeta or: [ 		 each comment = 'TODO' or: [ 			 each instanceSide organization classComment isEmpty or: [ 				 (each comment includes: Character cr) not ] ] ] ]) sort: [ :a :b | 	a comment size < b comment size ]- See also: [[How to find the repo a class belongs to?]]
