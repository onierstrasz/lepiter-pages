---Title: Visualizations for Class Comments---#Visualizations for Class Comments- [[todo]] [[projects]] [[comment-analysis]] [[visualizations]]- #Comment similarity    - [[PR]] implemented in Pharo some years ago a visualization to compare comment lines with similar or duplicated comment lines in other classes.    - Used doc2vec python library to identify similar lines. Could indicate percentage of similarity.    - Would just show a list of similar lines in other classes.- #Comment structure    - Used NLP to dhow the grannatical structure of sentences in comments.- #Comment hierarchies    - Show for project hierarchies which classes are commented.    - Each class box has fan in and fan out columns indicating how “important” the class is.    - Seminar project with [[PR]], [[AB]] and [[TK]] from Spring 2022.- #Stereotypes ?    - No visualization yet. See [[Stereotype analysis for Pharo classes]].
