Too complex to load.- Would like Bloc in other languages.- Compile bloc to WebAssembly?- Should be able to use the editor in the browser.- Views are limited in expressive power -- need to instantiate Bloc elements in other environments.- The goal is to turn GT into a shared environment for technical and non-technical users.- Doing this with PolyPoly now. Need to guide the users for now.- Audience is mostly people who don't have ST experience. Pharo and Squeak users are happy with their environment.- Opening window needs to be more friendly.
