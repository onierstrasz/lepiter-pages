Reading is not the goal but a means.    - Problem is that systems are highly contextual.    - Can't predict the questions people will have, so we don't know what tools we will need.    - Start from the question, not the tool.    - Existing tools don't work, because they  don't get at the interesting questions.    - Creation of new tools must be cheap: this is *moldable development*    - Moldable development is a new way of programming.    - Most of the energy has gone into how we look at a single object. Typical “Inspector” view is generic look at the state.    - Instead offer the possibility of multiple, contextual views for objects.    - This changes how we relate to the system.    - An example is like a test but returns an object. We can explore examples with dediacted views. Example of a text editor: {{gtExample:name=BrTextEditorSelecterExamples>>#select_word_at_2}}    - This allows us to build *narratives* about a system.    - Example of dependencies induced by *feature toggles*.    - The exists no off-the-shelf tool to analyze or visualize such dependencies.    - [[TK]] What do we see here? are these modules? (TG explains how feature toggles introduce module dependencies. Need to define a tool to extract this information from the source code.)    - Everything is moldable. For example, can have a dedicated view for the {{gtClass:name=PythonParser}} specification. (Note the tabs.)- #Discussion    - [[TK]] Plugin development is shifted to the user of the IDE?    - [[TG]] GT comes with almost 2000 plugins. The cost of plugins is much lower.    - #gtView gtPragmas size    - An average of ~12 LOC per view.    - (#gtView gtPragmas contents sum: #linesOfCode)/ #gtView gtPragmas size    - [[AB]]How do you compose views?    - [[TG]] All these different views are completely integrated, so we can navigate from a notebook to an Inspector, to a code editor.    - Since you have all the inspectors and plygrounds available everywhere, you can combine them in unexpected ways. From each Inspector you have a dedicated playground.    - [[TK]] So this is all done statically?    - [[TG]] Example of Squarified Treemap algorithm. From the paper we see a hand-drawn diagram of the algorithm. The diagram in GT is live, and can show how it was generated.    - [[TK]] Who is able to program such views?    - [[TG]] So far we have been doing the validation ourselves. We want to convince others to pick it up. Obviously our case studies are selected to show off the advantages.    - In our experience we can show people new things about their legacy systems that they have been working with for many years.    - [[PR]] I was recently reviewing an article about how to evaluate scientific software. Could GT be used for this? Multiple views could be useful.    - [[TG]] We are doing this primarily to show that to support moldable development you need the underlying technology first. It doesn't have to be Smalltalk.    - Cozy Corner Example — worked with a customer to develop an executable domain model. The view was created primarily for engineering needs (to debug examples faster), but as a side effect it enabled better communication with the customer.    - [[TK]] Lately in the SE community, Andreas Zeller has been talking about [“Illustrated code”](https://conf.researchr.org/info/ase-2021/keynote).    - [[TG]] Yes, but GT is already implemented and has been applied to many cases.    - They are using Jupyter notebooks, but this is far more limited. They are not rethinking the idea of the Inspector.    - [[TK]] Do you assume that you start development with GT?    - [[TG]] No. You can use GT to reason about and create narratives about systems that already exist.    - Using existing tools is like trying to play basketball while wearing a straitjacket.    - We used to think that creating a parser is a hard problem. Now it's often just a question of a day or so (for example to parse a particular data format).    - Example of a macro system built on top of COBOL. The only documentation was obsolete.    - Now we don't even ask managers what language they are using, because they don't really now. We build a parser in the first month of a project.    - “Illustrated Code” is nice, but it is just looking at a narrow window of the problem.    - Shows example of {{gtPage:How to visualize the current database|db=2j9m7db2i4oz116bexd7wbdxo}}.    - Can navigate from queries to objects to editors, or from visualizations of dependencies to actual objects.    - See example of graph with and without the TOC.    - Just a notebook is not enough — you need to be able to navigate to live objects, editors etc.    - Every meaningful problem in SE requires input from multiple sources.- #Projects    - [[TK]] What would be a possible project for a Bachelor or MSc student?    - [[PR]] GT could be applied to analyzing scientific software.    - [[TK]] Highly configurable softwware (like feature toggles) and variability mining could be interesting.    - [[TG]] All of these are interesting, but the difference in impact comes when there is someone who sees a special *value added* (in speed, in decision making, etc.).    - We are looking for “operators” in the environment that make it easier to develop new tools and narratives cheaply and quickly.    - We build views as engineering tools while we build the system.    - Which of these views tend to be useful in other contexts? Perhaps 10% tend to be reused, but this is still economically viable (because the views are cheap).    - The key idea is that *the environment can no longer be static*. The user should be able to *choose which lens to use to view the system*.    - How do you teach newcomers to program in this way?    - Alan Kay said, “Don't study programmers; study kids.”    - [[TK]] So you create domain-specific languages on the fly?    - [[TG]] Yes, that's it.    - The reason I'm interested in this conversation is that I think this is just the beginning of a discussion of what sustainable software is. Current software development is not sustainable. The amount of software being developed is not maintainable.    - [[TK]] What are your greatest success stories?    - [[TG]] We don't advertise them on our web site. It doesn't help to try to convince customers — we need the ones who are already convinced.    - The teaching part is the most important part we need to address.    - DevOps was a small, boring idea, automating the step from development  to deployment, yet it enabled AWS and many other new business models.    - [[TK]] studying “narrative patterns” could be interesting.    - [[TG]] Usually people learn to reda before they write, but in programming we teach people to write code, but reading is optional. This seems wrong.    - A SE course should start with a big legacy system.    - [[TK]]  I'm interested in integrating this into teaching somehow, such as B and MSc theses and seminars. Also as a research vehicle.    - Will think about it and propose a new meeting in a couple of weeks.
