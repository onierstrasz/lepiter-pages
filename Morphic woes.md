* Why I use Morphic
- Refactorings (e.g. create accessors) on instance variables
- Recover source changes
- Method history revert / diff
- Method versions (git)
- Traditional browser structure / compactness
- Key jump in selector list
- Creating methods on the class side
- Visual segregation of class methods
- Debugger
- Too easy to lose source from dirty methods
- Class hierarchy object death trap
- Filter on package list
