If we search for methods containing this text:- 'Apply changes' gtSubstringMatch- we find that the method is {{gtMethod:name=GtEpicea>>gtTutorialFor:}}.- So we navigate from the change snippet to its view model to get the GtEpicea changes:- changeSnippets first asSnippetViewModel changes- Finally, given a particular page, we can evaluate all the change snippets:- aPage := memoryPage.(aPage	 deep: #children	 select: [ :child | child isKindOf: LeChangesSnippet ]) 	do: [ :each | 		each asSnippetViewModel changes applyChanges ]- To apply all the changes of the memory game, we can run the following script:- pageTitles := #( 'Implementing the Memory Game Model'                 'Implementing the Memory Game Model Logic'                 'Building the Memory Game Graphical Elements with Bloc'                 'Playing the Memory Game' ).gtBook := thisSnippet database logicalDatabase databases detect: [ :db | 	          db databaseName = 'Glamorous Toolkit Book' ].pages := pageTitles collect: [ :title | 	         gtBook pages detect: [ :each | each title = title ] ].pages do: [ :page | 	(page		 deep: #children		 select: [ :child | child isKindOf: LeChangesSnippet ]) do: [ :each | 		each asSnippetViewModel changes applyChanges ] ]
