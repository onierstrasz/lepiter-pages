---Title: Pooja comment visualization repos---#Pooja comment visualization repos- [[todo]] [[comment-analysis]] [[visualizations]]- Check these out- #Pooja Repos    - From [slack discussion](https://scg-unibe.slack.com/archives/D8Z0TM895/p1659616377993569).    - Hi Oscar, some links regarding comment related visualizations we discussed other day.    - Project 1. [](https://github.com/poojaruhal/Moose-Camel-AST)  
This creates an AST of a comment or a natural language sentence.    - Project 2: [](https://github.com/poojaruhal/Moose-Camel)
It uses project 1 to convert natural language queries to moose queries.    - Project 3. [](https://github.com/bergel/VisualizingClassHierarchies)
Visualizing class hierarchies. Java dataset (JSON) used in this project is extracted using a JavaDocExtractor https://github.com/UsernameN0tAvailable/java_doc_extractor (you wonâ€™t need it).        - Pooja says there is data [in this repo](https://github.com/UsernameN0tAvailable/java_doc_extractor/blob/master/results.tar.gz) to be visualized.    - Project 4. [](https://github.com/poojaruhal/Moose-Camel-Comments)
These are various analyses I used for our Empirical software engineering papers (What do class comments tell us?)    - - [](https://github.com/poojaruhal/DocumentationHierarchyAnalysis) 
In this project, I started analyzing the hierarchy of class comments within a project. However, I realized I first needed more empirical insights to figure out how the visualization should look, which we explored in Project 3.    - Unfortunately, Project 1 & 2 were done on Mac 32-bit architecture machine, so I cannot run those Pharo images now.
I really wanted them to migrate and make them work before giving you but unfortunately could not find much time last two weeks. I hope they can still give some hints. I can work on them next week (after coming back).
