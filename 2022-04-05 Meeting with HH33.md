Followed the MOOC.- Hi Oscar,
I'm getting ready for our call.
Thanks again for the time you're setting doing this.
I hope you don't mind that I planned on some questions/thoughts I'd like to address today.
I made a short list, maybe we could go through some of it. 
Here it is : 

Possible meat of our talk :- #How/demo on how to browse my filesystem with GT?- FileLocator imageDirectory- FileLocator allInstances- '/Users/oscar/Desktop/GT' asFileReference- '123' asInteger- #How could I tag some documents within my file systems?- -So that then I'd be able to run "queries" with combinations of tags to retrieve a list/result of  the documents with those specific tags? 
-How much a class can an document (.doc .txt .jpg...) be ?
 -If a document can be manipulated as/is-technically a class can I use some pre-existing  slot/field within the design of that class to tag it ?- #Optional fantasies to be debunked :- I'm imagining that once I got a handle on those questions/issues I might use the Google Keep API to manage and edit my Google Keep notes within GT.- -There is a feature which I feel is missing from this app by Google, namely this ability to run  queries which use several tags (for info you can do that in Gmail). Maybe I could tweak  something. 
-Then venturing further in the land of speculative imagination, I'd like one day to be able to bring some datas I'll be manipulating in GT within to the widgets/homescreen/app-even of my mobile device (Android)- Thank you Oscar. 
See you in a bit
Henri
