I can drill into a snippet, find the shortcuts, find that the code is `self increaseFontSize`, inspect the `LePageToolContentTreeElement` and evaluate the code in its playground to verify that the font size of the page indeed increases. But what I cannot figure out is how to navigate from a particular instance of the page to this `LePageToolContentTreeElement` without drilling. How do I get from the model to this particular view element?
