---Title: Scripter examples are not correctly showing the steps #2733---#Scripter examples are not correctly showing the steps #2733- [[issue]]  [#2733](https://github.com/feenkcom/gtoolkit/issues/2733)- Run the example: {{gtMethod:name=GtWorldByScripterExamples>>#executePlaygroundSnippet}}. The example runs fine, but the display is wrong. The performed steps should apparently be highlighted with blue circles, but instead these all appear clustered together at the bottom left.
