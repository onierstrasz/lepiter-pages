---Title: Strange issue with unknown link type---#Strange issue with unknown link type- [[issue]]- I had several lepiter pages in my default db contained bookmarked links to the Smalltalk Intro page in the gt book.- I moved those pages to the gt book itself, but the bookmarks stayed as bookmarks, rather than ordinary links.- When I tried to rename the target page, it generated an unknown link type exception.- Of course the bookmarks were not updated.
