Instead we want to order the threads, so a series of requests will be executed in sequence by a single worker.- #Looking at AsyncFutureThreadPoolWorker    - I found {{gtClass:name=AsyncFutureThreadPoolWorker}} and {{gtClass:name=AsyncFutureThreadPoolWorkerExamples}}., but there are no practical examples.-     - worker := AsyncFutureThreadPoolWorker new.worker startup.worker    - worker schedule: (AsyncPendingFuturePromise new future: [42] asAsyncFuture).    - AsyncFutureThreadPoolWorker allInstances select: #isRunning    - AsyncFutureThreadPoolWorker allInstances	select: [ :each | each pendingQueueSize > 0 ]
