	baseline: 'GtTalks';
	repository: 'github://onierstrasz/gt-talks:main/src';
	load- Go to the method {{gtMethod:name=Vissoft2022Slideshow>>ludoIntro:}}.- There is a long, multi-line String literal in the method. Try to edit it, eg add an extra sentence.- At some point you will get an “I am an Oups NULL debugging exception” error. If you are unlucky, the image will freeze. If you are lucky, you will get an “AssertionFailure: Wrong layout state! It should be: 4 but it is 2”.
