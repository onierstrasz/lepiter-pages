---Title: About Zettelkasten---#About Zettelkasten- [[randomnote]]- I stumbled across this term in the [GT Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/729445214812504107/851502717472997397).- The main idea is to organize your work and ideas as categories of notes, namely *literature* notes, *reference* notes and *permanent* notes.    - **Literature notes** help you keep track of literature you find interesting. Summarize the key points and the context of interest. Be sure to note the exact source location.    - **Reference notes** help you to grouop or categorize notes (as with a hashtag).    - **Permanent notes** describe standalone ideas.    - **Fleeting notes** are unstructured and unorganized notes that will eventually be organized.    - See [A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to the Zettelkasten Method](https://zenkit.com/en/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-the-zettelkasten-method/).- There is a book by Soenke Ahrens called [How to take Smart Notes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WVYW33Y/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0), but according to [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/34507927-how-to-take-smart-notes) it seems to be rather verbose.- #Related stuff    - Look at the [PARA Method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) and the [Forte labs productivity blog](https://fortelabs.com/blog/).
