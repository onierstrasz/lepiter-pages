Would like to have more flexibility. Could also conflate with boxes to query which cards were incorrectly answered.- Will need a database of cards.- Card consists of question and answer. Each is a description. Can be played in different ways.- Cards could take different forms, Could just be Q&A strings, or be more complex.- Scenarios: create a card. Is answer correct or not.- First step is to create a model of the cards before going to more complex scenarios.- Proposes to use Magritte. See {{gtClass:name=GtMagritteModelExamples}}.
