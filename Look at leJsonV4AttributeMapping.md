That would be a lot of storeOn: methods, and also other people would need to add that in their custom snippets. An alternative would be to rely on `leJsonV4AttributeMapping`  to define the storing.”    - I tried this, but found nothing:    - #leJsonV4AttributeMapping gtSenders & #gtExample gtPragmas    - “Maybe {{gtMethod:name=LeContentAttributesReloader>>allContentAttributeMappings}} and {{gtMethod:name=LeContentAttributesReloader>>updateAttributeForMapping:fromContent:}}. When reloading a database we had to detect if any property of a snippet changed to trigger the reload. Initially we had a changed  method in every snippet. We replaced that with {{gtClass:name=LeContentAttributesReloader}}  that gets all properties of a snippet and ignores a few ( ignoredAttributes ).
Three snippets are still somehow special. You can check who overrides reloadAttributesFromContent: . The really special one is {{gtClass:name=LeUnknownSnippet}}  that does not exist on disk, but is created dynamically when reading a snippet that has a type not present in the image”
