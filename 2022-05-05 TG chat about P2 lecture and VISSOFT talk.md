When they have code, they read it.    - “Architecture is an emerging artifact”        - In a typical IDE you don't see this.    - Shows visualizations of an ESE system as it evolves.        - Did same experiment with multiple ESE projects.        - Externally they looked similar, but the visualizations showed very different internal structures.        - But the structure is critical for future evolution. So *structure should be a first-class entity* that you can visualize.    - Difficulty of tracking how UI, design and implementation evolve — need to make them all visible. (UX — User experience ; DX — Developer experience.)    - Examples of different visualizations for different problems.    - Example of {{gtMethod:name=GtTour>>treemapWithViewsAndExamples}}.    - At the time did not think of moldable development as a way to *drive* the development, but rather just a way to reason about the system.    - **Message:** So the message is that moldable development offers a critical discipline and methodology to drive developement by making the insides of systems explainable, not just for technical people!    - Also at the time did not have the one rendering tree.    - Instead of adding things to the editor, have visualizations as the central entities.    - Could develop and show a prototype of a code bubbles-like tool.    - **Connections:** From an example method can click on the (eg) button, go to the *Connections* view, and then clicking on messages, see the connections between methods.    - Should definitely show the connections view.    - Want to get people interested in building visualizations with GT.    - There was also a prototype for lepiter pages, but it's not maintained.    - Can use Restaurant example and Ludo example.    - Get TG's “Visual Examples of Moldable Development” lepiter page    - Need new interfaces; need new infrastructures => need for one rendering tree- #Ludo Board    - Want to show moves as hops on the board.
