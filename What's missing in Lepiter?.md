---Title: What's missing in Lepiter?---#What's missing in Lepiter?- [[lepiter]]- [[SDN]] on discord [lists what's missing](https://discord.com/channels/729445214812504107/735947900651175998/1068449029622616075) from his perspective.- 1. Tranclusion - this is huge- 2. Snippet linking supported in the UI, see e.g. [](https://discord.com/channels/729445214812504107/745659858665341080/932789884979146802)- 3. Refactoring needed to make it easy to customize in practice e.g. not enough delegation to the page’s type, or (probably better yet) allow LePage subclasses. See e.g. [](https://github.com/feenkcom/gtoolkit/issues/2413), [](https://discord.com/channels/729445214812504107/737255889517543545/935558296310534275)- 4. Markdown missing e.g. tables, making it hard to import/export e.g. to GH- 5. GH issue snippet pulls in entire discussion, is not collapsible (as of 7/27/2022)- 6. gtPage annotations broken for other DBs and label can’t be set [](https://github.com/feenkcom/gtoolkit/issues/2647)- 7. Books (e.g. GT’s) don’t have a search feature- 8. Refactorings don’t affect Lepiter (okay, maybe not PKM related)- 9.  No page link labels. See [](https://discord.com/channels/729445214812504107/729445215341117522/926981971933024306)- 10. Difficult to add a new page (especially now w/o the global Spotter). Would be good to have a button on existing pages or the sidebar. See [](https://discord.com/channels/729445214812504107/737255889517543545/900909879726845963)- 11. Typed links, user-specified. See [](https://discord.com/channels/729445214812504107/737255889517543545/858008566094495774)- 12. Arbitrary meta data attached to snippets. See [](https://discord.com/channels/729445214812504107/737255889517543545/858008566094495774)
