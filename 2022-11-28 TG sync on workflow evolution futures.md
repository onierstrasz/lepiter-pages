If you need all the results, streams might not be what you need.- Rather you can cache the results after computing them once.- You could also run several images on your multi-core machine.- There exists a mechanism to run tasks with workers. WIth lifeWare we run the slow tests firsts.- Then you need the metrics.- Look at the Metrics tab of a filter.- #gtView gtPragmas- You could have a stream of History objects. See {{gtClass:name=GtAsyncSearchMethodGroupStream}}.- See {{gtMethod:name=GtAsyncSearchMethodGroupStream>>#metrics}}  which uses {{gtMethod:name=TAsyncStream>>#forEach:}} to create the futures.
