---Title: * Add the storeString for GraphQL (and other) snippets---#* Add the storeString for GraphQL (and other) snippets- [[todo]] [[asap]]- [[issue]] [3152](https://github.com/feenkcom/gtoolkit/issues/3152) feenkcom/gtoolkit#3152- storeString is not implemented for all snippet types.- See also [[How to clone the GT Book]]- #Querying snippet types    - Which snippet types have abstract storeOn: methods?    - isAbstract := (LeSnippet allSubclasses		select: [ :each | (each lookupSelector: #storeOn:) isAbstract ])		sort: [ :a :b | a name <= b name ].    - Which snippet types used in the book have abstract storeOn: methods?    - isAbstract := (LeSnippet allSubclasses		select: [ :each | (each lookupSelector: #storeOn:) isAbstract ])		sort: [ :a :b | a name <= b name ].gtBook := LeStorageExamples new gtBook.allSnippets := (gtBook pages deepCollect: #children)		select: [ :each | each isKindOf: LeSnippet ].snippetTypes := (allSnippets collect: #class) asBag sortedCounts.snippetTypes select: [ :each | isAbstract includes: each value ].    - Find snippets:    - snippetsToFind := LePharoRewriteSnippet.allSnippets select: [ :each | each isKindOf: snippetsToFind ].    - Find pages with snippets.    - snippetsToFind := LeUnknownSnippet.LeStorageExamples new gtBook pages	select: [ :each | 		(each deep: #children select: [ :child | child isKindOf: snippetsToFind ])			notEmpty ]- #Unused snippets    - The remaining snippet types don;t appear in the book. Are they needed?    - [[TG]] says:        - LeTextualSnippet is an abstract class, right?
LeMockedSnippet is used for testing
The rest are not exemplified. Jenkins is particularly useful
we will play with LeDockerSnippet this week
the GitHub snippets were more for exploration    - Where is {{gtClass:name=LeDockerSnippet}} used?- #LePharoRewriteSnippet    - snippetsToFind := LePharoRewriteSnippet.pages := gtBook pages	select: [ :each | (each deep: #children 		select: [ :child | child isKindOf: snippetsToFind ]) notEmpty ].pages first.    - We only need to set `search` and `replace` in {{gtMethod:name=LePharoRewriteSnippet>>#storeOn:}}.- #LeYoutubeReferenceSnippet    - snippetsToFind := LeYoutubeReferenceSnippet.pages := gtBook pages	select: [ :each | (each deep: #children 		select: [ :child | child isKindOf: snippetsToFind ]) notEmpty ].pages first.    - Here we only need to set the `urlString` in {{gtMethod:name=LeYoutubeReferenceSnippet>>#storeOn:}}.- #GtGQLSnippet    - [[EOG]] needed it for this GT Book page: {{gtPage:Exploring GitHub through GraphQL |db=2j9m7db2i4oz116bexd7wbdxo}}    - Need to implement {{gtMethod:name=GtGQLSnippet>>#storeOn:}}.    - (GtGQLSnippet new input: '{
	"ownername": "feenkcom",
	"reponame": "gtoolkit"
}'; operation: 'query Repository($ownername: String!, $reponame: String!) {
	repository(owner: $ownername, name: $reponame) {

	}
}'; yourself)
