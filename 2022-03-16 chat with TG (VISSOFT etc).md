[[Prepare ICSME industrial paper or tools demo]]- #Some ideas to Prepare VISSOFT Keynote]    - See [[VISSOFT 2022 Keynote]]    - Just go through the visualizations of GT that solve actual problems.    - Talk about the environment as the language.    - Every view is a predicate in a sentence — concatenation of panes creates a narrative.    - Lots of plugins available can create many different kinds of narratives.    - Can communicate much faster.
